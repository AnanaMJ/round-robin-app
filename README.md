# RoundRobin

## Slack App that schedules rotations

---

Inspired by [this Medium post](https://medium.com/in-the-weeds/round-robin-rotating-responsibilities-responsibly-f4a9b44e174c).

Used:

- [validate-slack-request module](https://github.com/gverni/validate-slack-request) after struggling to do it myself;
- [this Atlas project](https://github.com/markormesher/atlas) to handle secrets in Docker and Postgres;
- [this guide for slack apps](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok) to get started.
